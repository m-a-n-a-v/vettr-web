## FUND2-001: Enhance Insider Activity with Smart Money signal and accumulation/distribution indicator
Status: COMPLETE
Date: Mon Feb 24 2026
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Updated InsiderActivity interface in src/types/fundamentals.ts with new fields: institutionChangePercent, topHoldersConcentration, smartMoneySignal, and quarterlyOwnershipHistory
- Enhanced dummy data generator (src/lib/dummy-fundamentals.ts) to produce realistic smart money signals based on institutional flow, concentration risk levels, and 4 quarters of ownership history
- Completely redesigned src/components/fundamentals/InsiderActivity.tsx:
  - Added Smart Money Signal badge in header with pulse animation for 'accumulating' state
  - Created 3-column metrics grid featuring Institutional Flow (3-month % change with directional arrow), Concentration Risk (top 5 holders % with Low/Moderate/High badge), and Net Activity
  - Integrated Recharts AreaChart showing quarterly ownership trend for both insiders and institutions with custom gradients
  - Maintained existing ownership breakdown stacked bar and recent transactions table
- All components follow VETTR design system: vettr-card backgrounds, emerald/yellow/red color coding, proper typography hierarchy
- npm run build passes successfully
- npm run lint passes (1 pre-existing warning in unrelated file)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Recharts Tooltip formatter requires handling undefined values in TypeScript - use `(value: number | undefined) => value !== undefined ? ... : 'N/A'`
- Smart money signals work well with deterministic dummy data by deriving signal from institutional change threshold (>5% = accumulating, <-5% = distributing)
- Area charts with gradients create excellent visual hierarchy for ownership trends
- Pulse animations on badges draw attention to positive signals without being distracting

## FUND2-002: Enhance Short Interest with trend chart and squeeze potential indicator
Status: COMPLETE
Date: Mon Feb 24 2026
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Updated ShortInterest interface in src/types/fundamentals.ts with new fields: shortInterestHistory (6 months of data), squeezePotential ('high' | 'moderate' | 'low'), and shortInterestChange (1-month % change)
- Enhanced dummy data generator (src/lib/dummy-fundamentals.ts) to produce:
  - 6 months of historical short interest data with realistic trend patterns (declining, rising, or volatile)
  - Squeeze potential calculation based on 3 factors: high SI (>8%), declining trend, and high days to cover (>5)
  - 1-month change calculation comparing current vs prior month
- Created new ShortInterestSection component (src/components/fundamentals/ShortInterestSection.tsx):
  - Retained original badge display showing short interest % and days to cover with color coding (green <3%, yellow 3-10%, red >10%)
  - Added Squeeze Potential badge with pulse animation for 'high' potential, color-coded appropriately
  - Added 1-Month Change indicator with directional arrow (green for declining = less bearish, red for rising = more bearish)
  - Integrated Recharts AreaChart showing 6-month short interest % trend with gradient fill
  - Added explanatory text for squeeze potential criteria based on current level
  - Preserved original tooltip functionality explaining what short interest means
- Replaced ShortInterestBadge with ShortInterestSection in Overview tab (src/app/(main)/stocks/[ticker]/page.tsx)
- All components follow VETTR design system patterns: vettr-card backgrounds, proper color coding, typography hierarchy
- npm run build passes successfully
- npm run lint passes (1 pre-existing warning in unrelated file)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Short interest trend analysis benefits from deterministic trend patterns (declining/rising/volatile) rather than pure random walk
- Squeeze potential is best calculated from multiple factors rather than single threshold - creates more nuanced signal
- Area charts with dynamic gradient colors based on current value create strong visual impact
- Color semantics matter: for short interest, declining = positive (green), rising = negative (red) since it's a bearish metric
- Historical data generation should maintain realistic constraints (0.5-15% range for short interest)

## FUND2-003: Create reusable Sparkline component
Status: COMPLETE
Date: Mon Feb 24 2026
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Created src/components/ui/Sparkline.tsx as a lightweight, reusable sparkline component
- Component features:
  - Pure SVG implementation (no Recharts dependency) for minimal overhead
  - Accepts data array and optional props: width (default 60px), height (default 20px), color, showDot (default true), className
  - Auto-color detection based on trend: green if last > first (trending up), red if declining, gray if flat
  - Smooth polyline rendering with proper scaling based on data min/max
  - Small dot on last data point for emphasis
  - Edge case handling: empty arrays, single values, flat data (prevents division by zero)
  - Uses vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke" to maintain consistent line width
- Tested with multiple data patterns: trending up, trending down, flat, volatile, custom colors, edge cases
- Positioned for use in cards (60-80px), tables (50px), and inline with metrics
- npm run build passes successfully
- Component ready for integration in next stories (Overview metrics, Financial Health cards, Fundamentals tables)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Pure SVG sparklines are much lighter than Recharts for simple trend visualization
- polyline with preserveAspectRatio="none" provides smooth line rendering without complex path interpolation
- Auto-color detection from first/last value is simple but effective for trend indication
- vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke" ensures consistent visual weight across different sizes
- Edge case handling (empty arrays, single points) is critical for reusable components
- className prop enables flexible positioning (inline, absolute, etc.) for different use cases

## FUND2-004: Add sparklines to Key Metrics cards in Overview tab
Status: COMPLETE
Date: Mon Feb 24 2026
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Added metricTrends field to FundamentalsData interface in src/types/fundamentals.ts with 8-quarter trends for: marketCap, peRatio, dividendYield, revenueGrowth, and price
- Enhanced dummy data generator (src/lib/dummy-fundamentals.ts) to produce realistic 8-quarter trend data:
  - Each metric has a deterministic trend pattern (rising, declining, volatile, improving, etc.) based on ticker seed
  - Market cap trends show 5% quarterly growth (rising), 3% decline, or ±10% volatility
  - P/E ratio trends show expanding/contracting multiples or volatility (±15%)
  - Dividend yield trends show increasing/decreasing yields or stable ±5% (only for stocks with dividends)
  - Revenue growth trends show improving (+2%/qtr), declining (-1.5%/qtr), or volatile patterns
  - Price trends show uptrends (+6%/qtr), downtrends (-4%/qtr), or sideways movement (±8%)
  - All trends maintain realistic bounds (market cap >$10M, PE 3-100, div yield 0-10%, etc.)
- Integrated Sparkline component into Overview tab Key Metrics section (src/app/(main)/stocks/[ticker]/page.tsx):
  - Added Sparkline import
  - Enhanced Market Cap card with sparkline in bottom-right corner showing 8-quarter market cap trend
  - Enhanced P/E Ratio card with sparkline showing 8-quarter PE trend
  - Enhanced Div Yield card with sparkline showing 8-quarter yield trend (only displayed when dividendYield > 0)
  - All sparklines positioned absolutely in bottom-right corner at 60px wide × 20px tall
  - Sparklines use auto-color detection (green for rising trends, red for declining)
- Exchange, Sector, and Filings cards intentionally excluded from sparklines as specified (categorical/count data)
- npm run build passes successfully with zero errors

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Deterministic trend patterns in dummy data create more realistic and meaningful sparklines than random walks
- Bottom-right absolute positioning works well for metric cards without interfering with main values
- Optional chaining (?.) is essential when accessing nested trend data to prevent runtime errors
- Sparkline component's auto-color feature works perfectly for metric trends - green for growth, red for decline
- 8 quarters of data provides good visual trend context without cluttering small sparklines
- Conditional rendering based on dividend yield (>0) prevents showing flat zero-value sparklines for non-dividend stocks
- Pure SVG sparklines integrate seamlessly into existing card layouts without layout shift

## FUND2-005: Add sparklines to Financial Health Dashboard metrics
Status: COMPLETE
Date: Mon Feb 24 2026
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Added healthTrends field to FinancialHealth interface in src/types/fundamentals.ts containing 6-quarter trend data for: cashRunway, debtCoverage, fcfYield, currentRatio, debtToEquity, and altmanZ
- Enhanced dummy data generator (src/lib/dummy-fundamentals.ts) to produce 6 quarters of health trend data with realistic patterns:
  - Each metric follows a deterministic trend pattern (improving, declining, stable, worsening) based on ticker seed
  - Cash runway trends show declining (burning cash), stable, or improving patterns
  - Debt coverage trends show improving, stable, or declining coverage ability
  - FCF yield trends show improving, volatile, or declining free cash flow generation
  - Current ratio trends show improving liquidity, stable, or declining
  - Debt-to-equity trends show improving (declining ratio), stable, or worsening leverage
  - Altman Z-Score trends show improving financial health, stable, or declining
  - All trends maintain realistic bounds (runway 3-36mo, debt coverage 0.5-10x, FCF yield -5% to 15%, etc.)
- Updated FinancialHealthDashboard.tsx component:
  - Added Sparkline import and integration
  - Enhanced MetricCard component to accept sparklineData and invertSparklineColors props
  - Added sparkline rendering positioned below main value, above status badge at 80px wide × 24px tall
  - Implemented inverted color logic for debt-to-equity metric (declining = green, rising = red) since lower is better
  - All 6 metric cards now display trend sparklines: Cash Runway, Altman Z-Score, Debt Coverage, FCF Yield, Current Ratio, Debt/Equity
  - Sparklines use auto-color detection with optional inversion for metrics where lower is better
- All components follow VETTR design system patterns: consistent sizing, proper positioning, clean integration
- npm run build passes successfully with zero errors

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Inverted color logic for "lower is better" metrics (debt ratios) is essential for correct visual communication
- Positioning sparklines between main value and status badge creates clear visual hierarchy without crowding
- 6 quarters of trend data provides meaningful context for health metrics without overwhelming the sparkline
- Optional chaining (?.) when accessing healthTrends prevents runtime errors if data structure evolves
- Deterministic trend patterns in dummy data (improving/declining/stable) create realistic and consistent visualizations
- The invertSparklineColors prop pattern allows flexible sparkline color semantics based on metric characteristics
- 80px × 24px sizing for health metric sparklines balances visibility with card real estate
