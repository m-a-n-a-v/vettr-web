## FUND2-001: Enhance Insider Activity with Smart Money signal and accumulation/distribution indicator
Status: COMPLETE
Date: Mon Feb 24 2026
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Updated InsiderActivity interface in src/types/fundamentals.ts with new fields: institutionChangePercent, topHoldersConcentration, smartMoneySignal, and quarterlyOwnershipHistory
- Enhanced dummy data generator (src/lib/dummy-fundamentals.ts) to produce realistic smart money signals based on institutional flow, concentration risk levels, and 4 quarters of ownership history
- Completely redesigned src/components/fundamentals/InsiderActivity.tsx:
  - Added Smart Money Signal badge in header with pulse animation for 'accumulating' state
  - Created 3-column metrics grid featuring Institutional Flow (3-month % change with directional arrow), Concentration Risk (top 5 holders % with Low/Moderate/High badge), and Net Activity
  - Integrated Recharts AreaChart showing quarterly ownership trend for both insiders and institutions with custom gradients
  - Maintained existing ownership breakdown stacked bar and recent transactions table
- All components follow VETTR design system: vettr-card backgrounds, emerald/yellow/red color coding, proper typography hierarchy
- npm run build passes successfully
- npm run lint passes (1 pre-existing warning in unrelated file)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Recharts Tooltip formatter requires handling undefined values in TypeScript - use `(value: number | undefined) => value !== undefined ? ... : 'N/A'`
- Smart money signals work well with deterministic dummy data by deriving signal from institutional change threshold (>5% = accumulating, <-5% = distributing)
- Area charts with gradients create excellent visual hierarchy for ownership trends
- Pulse animations on badges draw attention to positive signals without being distracting

## FUND2-002: Enhance Short Interest with trend chart and squeeze potential indicator
Status: COMPLETE
Date: Mon Feb 24 2026
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Updated ShortInterest interface in src/types/fundamentals.ts with new fields: shortInterestHistory (6 months of data), squeezePotential ('high' | 'moderate' | 'low'), and shortInterestChange (1-month % change)
- Enhanced dummy data generator (src/lib/dummy-fundamentals.ts) to produce:
  - 6 months of historical short interest data with realistic trend patterns (declining, rising, or volatile)
  - Squeeze potential calculation based on 3 factors: high SI (>8%), declining trend, and high days to cover (>5)
  - 1-month change calculation comparing current vs prior month
- Created new ShortInterestSection component (src/components/fundamentals/ShortInterestSection.tsx):
  - Retained original badge display showing short interest % and days to cover with color coding (green <3%, yellow 3-10%, red >10%)
  - Added Squeeze Potential badge with pulse animation for 'high' potential, color-coded appropriately
  - Added 1-Month Change indicator with directional arrow (green for declining = less bearish, red for rising = more bearish)
  - Integrated Recharts AreaChart showing 6-month short interest % trend with gradient fill
  - Added explanatory text for squeeze potential criteria based on current level
  - Preserved original tooltip functionality explaining what short interest means
- Replaced ShortInterestBadge with ShortInterestSection in Overview tab (src/app/(main)/stocks/[ticker]/page.tsx)
- All components follow VETTR design system patterns: vettr-card backgrounds, proper color coding, typography hierarchy
- npm run build passes successfully
- npm run lint passes (1 pre-existing warning in unrelated file)

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Short interest trend analysis benefits from deterministic trend patterns (declining/rising/volatile) rather than pure random walk
- Squeeze potential is best calculated from multiple factors rather than single threshold - creates more nuanced signal
- Area charts with dynamic gradient colors based on current value create strong visual impact
- Color semantics matter: for short interest, declining = positive (green), rising = negative (red) since it's a bearish metric
- Historical data generation should maintain realistic constraints (0.5-15% range for short interest)
