# VETTR Web App V2 Redesign - Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns

### Key Architectural Decisions
- Next.js 14+ App Router with route groups: `(auth)` and `(main)`
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Inter font loaded via next/font/google with CSS variable pattern
- VETTR design tokens: vettr-navy, vettr-dark, vettr-card, vettr-accent, foreground
- CSS custom properties for runtime theming: --color-accent, --color-surface, --color-border

### Design System Tokens
- Colors: vettr-navy (#0D1B2A), vettr-dark (#1B2838), vettr-card (#1E3348), vettr-accent (#00E676), foreground (#E8EDF2)
- Border radius: rounded-lg (inputs), rounded-xl (buttons), rounded-2xl (cards)
- Typography: Inter font with display: swap
- Background gradients: bg-gradient-accent (4% opacity), bg-gradient-accent-strong (8% opacity), bg-gradient-dual (accent + blue)

### Component Patterns to Follow
- Cards: `bg-vettr-card/50 border border-white/5 rounded-2xl p-5 hover:border-vettr-accent/20 hover:bg-vettr-card/80 transition-all duration-300`
- Inputs: `bg-white/5 border border-white/10 rounded-xl px-4 py-2.5 text-white placeholder-gray-500 focus:border-vettr-accent/40 focus:ring-1 focus:ring-vettr-accent/20 transition-all`
- Buttons (Primary): `bg-vettr-accent text-vettr-navy font-semibold rounded-xl px-4 py-2.5 hover:bg-vettr-accent/90 transition-colors`
- Buttons (Secondary): `bg-white/5 border border-white/10 text-white rounded-xl px-4 py-2.5 hover:bg-white/10 transition-colors`

## V2-001: Fix global CSS, Tailwind config, and design tokens
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-12
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Configured Inter font as CSS variable (--font-inter) using next/font/google with display: swap
- Updated tailwind.config.ts with VETTR design tokens: vettr-navy, vettr-dark, vettr-card, vettr-accent, foreground
- Added consistent border-radius tokens in Tailwind config
- Added CSS custom properties in globals.css for runtime theming
- Implemented smooth scrolling, antialiased text rendering
- Added ::selection styling with rgba(0,230,118,0.3) background
- Created subtle background gradient utilities: bg-gradient-accent, bg-gradient-accent-strong, bg-gradient-dual
- Removed hardcoded hex colors from utility classes, replaced with CSS variables
- Added typography scale in Tailwind config with proper line heights
- All quality checks passed: npm run build ✓, npm run lint ✓

Files modified:
- tailwind.config.ts
- src/app/globals.css
- src/app/layout.tsx

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Inter font was already imported but not using CSS variable pattern - updated to use variable for consistency
- CSS custom properties allow runtime theming while Tailwind tokens provide compile-time consistency
- Background gradient utilities should be positioned absolutely to avoid layout interference
- Selection styling improves user experience with brand colors
- Always run both build and lint before committing

## V2-002: Re-enable and fix authentication flow completely
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-12
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Re-enabled ProtectedRoute component with proper authentication checks
- ProtectedRoute now reads isAuthenticated and isLoading from AuthContext via useAuth hook
- Added loading state display: VETTR logo with animated pulsing dots (no flash of login page)
- Loading screen uses vettr-navy background with accent-colored logo and pulse animation
- Re-enabled auth redirect in api-client.ts: redirects to /login on 401 after refresh fails
- AuthContext already properly initializes from localStorage on mount and validates tokens with /users/me
- Token refresh flow works: on 401, calls /auth/refresh, retries original request with new token
- If refresh fails, clears tokens and redirects to /login
- ProtectedRoute redirects to /login if not authenticated (after loading completes)
- All quality checks passed: npm run build ✓, npm run lint ✓

Files modified:
- src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx
- src/lib/api-client.ts

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The AuthContext was already well-implemented with token management and refresh logic
- The api-client.ts had commented-out auth redirect that just needed to be uncommented
- Loading state is critical to prevent flash of wrong page during auth check
- Using useEffect with router.push for redirect is better than window.location for Next.js
- Animated loading dots use staggered animation delays for smooth effect
- Must return null after redirect to prevent rendering children during redirect

- Mobile: single column layout with logo at top, form card below
- Implemented subtle background gradients with accent glow (8% opacity green at top-right, 5% blue at bottom-left)
- Form card uses bg-vettr-card/50 border border-white/5 rounded-2xl p-8 matching design system
- Input fields: bg-white/5 border border-white/10 rounded-xl with proper focus states (border-vettr-accent/50, ring-vettr-accent/20)
- Submit button: bg-vettr-accent text-vettr-navy font-semibold with hover:bg-vettr-accent/90
- Error messages: text-red-400 with fade-in animation (animate-in)
- Loading spinner on submit button preserves layout with inline SVG
- VETTR logo styled with accent-colored first letter: <span className="text-vettr-accent">V</span>ETTR
- Signup link: text-gray-400 hover:text-vettr-accent transition-colors
- All quality checks passed: npm run build ✓, npm run lint ✓

Files modified:
- src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Split layout achieved with flex-col lg:flex-row on parent container
- Background gradients positioned absolutely with z-index management (gradients behind content)
- Desktop-only branding section uses hidden lg:flex for responsive behavior
- Mobile logo duplicated with lg:hidden to maintain mobile-first approach
- Focus states updated to use vettr-accent colors instead of generic accent
- Error fade-in uses animate-in class which should be available from Tailwind
- Loading state preserves button size by keeping both SVG and text inline

- Submit button: bg-vettr-accent text-vettr-navy with loading spinner
- VETTR logo styled with accent-colored first letter
- All quality checks passed: npm run build ✓, npm run lint ✓

Files modified:

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Split layout pattern from login page works perfectly for signup as well
- Password strength indicator uses 5 bars (0-4 levels) with color coding: red (0-1), yellow (2), green (3-4)
- Password match indicator shows real-time validation with SVG icons (checkmark/X)
- Reordered fields to have displayName first, then email, then password fields (better UX flow)
- All old design tokens (bg-primary, text-accent, bg-error, bg-warning, etc.) replaced with V2 tokens
- Focus states use vettr-accent/50 for border and vettr-accent/20 for ring

- Added StarIcon and StarFilledIcon to icon library (outline and filled versions)
- Card uses bg-vettr-card/50 border border-white/5 rounded-2xl with proper hover states
- Removed framer-motion hover animation (y-lift), replaced with CSS-only transition for performance
- Header row: ticker in text-vettr-accent, company name in text-gray-400, favorite star as SVG icon
- Favorite star: StarFilledIcon (yellow) when favorited, StarIcon (gray) when not, with hover scale animation
- Loading state: spinning border animation instead of emoji
- Price row: text-2xl font-bold text-white with PriceChangeIndicator
- Bottom row: SectorChip + VetrScoreBadge in flex justify-between layout
- Updated VetrScoreBadge to use V2 design tokens (vettr-accent, yellow-400, orange-400, red-400)

Files modified:
- src/components/icons/index.tsx (added StarIcon, StarFilledIcon)
- src/components/ui/StockCard.tsx
- src/components/ui/VetrScoreBadge.tsx
- src/components/ui/PriceChangeIndicator.tsx
- src/components/ui/SectorChip.tsx

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- StockCard should be simple and clean - removed unnecessary elements like initials avatar
- Favorite star positioned inline with ticker and company name for better space efficiency
- CSS-only hover transitions perform better than framer-motion for card hover (less JS overhead)
- StarIcon component uses fill="none" with stroke, StarFilledIcon uses fill="currentColor"
- Yellow-400 is the standard color for filled star icons (matches common UI patterns)
- Loading spinner for favorite toggle should be small inline element, not full icon replacement
- SectorChip default neutral color should be subtle (bg-white/5) not accent-colored
- VETTR score badge already has circular ring from V2-001, just needed color token updates
- Scale animation on star hover/click: hover:scale-110 with transition-all
- All old design tokens (text-textPrimary, bg-surface, text-accent, text-error, text-warning) replaced with V2 tokens

## V2-008: Redesign VetrScoreBadge with SVG ring visualization
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-13
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Completely redesigned VetrScoreBadge with proper SVG circular progress ring
- Removed framer-motion dependency, replaced with native requestAnimationFrame animation
- SVG structure: track ring (stroke rgba(255,255,255,0.1)) + progress ring (colored by score)
- Three sizes implemented: sm (32px), md (48px), lg (64px) with proportional stroke widths (2/3/4)
- Animated on mount: ring fills from 0 to target score with 1s ease-out transition
- Score number uses tabular-nums font variant for consistent width
- Optional label below ring with showLabel prop
- Colors from Tailwind theme: >=80 vettr-accent (#00E676), >=60 yellow-400 (#FBBF24), >=40 orange-400 (#FB923C), <40 red-400 (#F87171)
- SVG transform -rotate-90 to start progress from top (12 o'clock position)
- strokeDasharray and strokeDashoffset used for circular progress animation
- All quality checks passed: npm run build ✓, npm run lint ✓

Files modified:
- src/components/ui/VetrScoreBadge.tsx

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- requestAnimationFrame provides better performance than framer-motion for simple number animations
- SVG circles need transform -rotate-90 to start progress from top instead of 3 o'clock position
- circumference = 2 * π * radius, strokeDashoffset = circumference - (score/100) * circumference
- strokeLinecap="round" creates rounded ends on the progress ring for premium look
- tabular-nums font variant prevents number width shifting during animation
- Hex color constants are acceptable for direct stroke attribute (can't use Tailwind classes on SVG stroke)
- CSS transition on SVG circle with duration-1000 ease-out provides smooth animation
- Gap between badge and label increased from gap-1 to gap-2 for better visual spacing
- Relative wrapper div with absolute centered text overlay pattern works well for SVG rings

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- SearchInput icon positioning: left-4 (was left-3) with pl-11 on input for better spacing
- Clear button padding: p-1 (was p-0.5) for better touch target
- SelectDropdown focus state matches SearchInput: border-vettr-accent/40 ring-1 ring-vettr-accent/20
- Native select element background needs bg-white/5 to match V2 cards (browser default removed)

- All quality checks passed: npm run build ✓, npm run lint ✓

Files modified:
- src/components/icons/index.tsx (added 4 new toast icons)
- src/components/ui/Toast.tsx
- src/contexts/ToastContext.tsx

**Learnings for future iterations:**

Details:
- Completely redesigned Pulse page header with "Market Pulse" title and last updated timestamp in V2 design tokens
- Updated all metric cards with V2 styling: bg-vettr-card/50 border border-white/5 rounded-2xl p-5
- Metric cards use uppercase labels (text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase tracking-wider), text-2xl font-bold values
- Added ArrowUpIcon and ArrowDownIcon to icon library for change indicators
- Top Gainer and Top Loser cards now use SVG arrow icons with colored text (vettr-accent for up, red-400 for down)

- Severity colors updated to match V2 palette: red-400, orange-400, yellow-400 instead of old error/warning tokens
- Desktop tables should be hidden md:block with separate mobile card view using md:hidden
- Table columns should use text-sm for content, text-xs uppercase tracking-wider for headers
- Horizontal scroll sections benefit from snap-x snap-mandatory CSS for better UX
- Arrow icons work better than PriceChangeIndicator component for simple up/down indicators in metric cards
- Last updated timestamp integrated into header is cleaner than separate banner below header
- All old design tokens replaced: text-textPrimary → text-white, text-textSecondary → text-gray-400, text-textMuted → text-gray-500, bg-primaryLight → bg-vettr-card/50, border-border → border-white/5, text-accent → text-vettr-accent, text-error → text-red-400, text-warning → text-orange-400
