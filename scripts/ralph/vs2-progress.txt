## VS2-018: Update VetrScore TypeScript interfaces
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Updated src/types/api.ts to replace 5-pillar VetrScore interface with 4-pillar system
- Created new pillar interfaces: FinancialSurvivalSubScores, OperationalEfficiencySubScores, ShareholderStructureSubScores, MarketSentimentSubScores
- Created VetrScorePillar<T> generic interface for pillar structure with score, weight, and sub_scores
- Updated VetrScore interface to use new 4 pillars: financial_survival, operational_efficiency, shareholder_structure, market_sentiment
- Added null_pillars: string[] field to track pillars with missing data
- Removed old fields: components (with pedigree, filing_velocity, red_flag, growth, governance), bonus_points, penalty_points
- Updated VetrScoreHistoryPoint to include optional pillar scores: financial_survival_score, operational_efficiency_score, shareholder_structure_score, market_sentiment_score
- Fixed compilation errors in src/components/VetrScoreDetail.tsx by updating component breakdown to use new 4-pillar structure
- Fixed compilation errors in src/app/(main)/stocks/[ticker]/page.tsx by updating score display to use new pillars
- All quality checks passed: npm run build ✓, npm run lint ✓

Files Modified:
- src/types/api.ts
- src/components/VetrScoreDetail.tsx
- src/app/(main)/stocks/[ticker]/page.tsx

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When updating TypeScript interfaces, must fix all compilation errors immediately to satisfy "npm run build passes" acceptance criteria
- The 4-pillar structure uses a more sophisticated nested approach with score, weight, and sub_scores for each pillar
- VetrScoreDetail and stock detail page needed immediate updates to prevent build failures
- The new structure better reflects the backend's weighted scoring system and data availability handling

## VS2-019: Update VetrScoreBadge to 5-tier colors
Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Date: 2026-02-15
Working Directory: /Users/manav/Space/code/vettr-web
Details:
- Updated src/components/ui/VetrScoreBadge.tsx getStrokeColor function to implement the new 5-tier color scale
- Changed from 4-tier (80+, 60+, 40+, <40) to 5-tier (90-100, 75-89, 50-74, 30-49, 0-29)
- New color mappings:
  - 90-100: #166534 (dark green)
  - 75-89: #00E676 (green - vettr-accent)
  - 50-74: #FBBF24 (yellow)
  - 30-49: #FB923C (orange)
  - 0-29: #F87171 (red)
- Component already showed only numeric score without text labels, no changes needed there
- All quality checks passed: npm run build ✓, npm run lint ✓

Files Modified:
- src/components/ui/VetrScoreBadge.tsx

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The VetrScoreBadge component was already well-structured without text labels
- The circular progress ring visual now properly reflects the new 5-tier scoring system
- This change ensures consistency across all score displays in the app with the new color grading system
